Summary of Lists:

Renderling list and Conditional content:
* Creating truly dynamic apps.
* We cannot add the if statement logic within the return statement.
* {<condition> ? <div> </div> :null}
* React will render the DOM only if the condition is true.
* Everything within the render() method gets whenever react rerenders the component.
* Looping an array, we can use of map()
	{this.state.persons.map ((person,index)=>{})}
* Always update the state in an immutable fashion using [...] spread operator.

List Keys:
* Key property:We need add key property while rendering lists.
* Key property helps react update the lit efficiently.
